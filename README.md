This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# CSCI495-C2

## Description / Purpose
The purpose of this project was for me to get my feet wet with building React components and implementing them within a react web application. I wanted to challenge myself with my current full stack knowlege and expand it by using a different server and database. I found it to be very frustrating reading over documentation I knew was obsolete but express does get the job done. 


## Dependencies
- "bcrypt-nodejs": "0.0.3"
- "body-parser": "^1.19.0"
- "cors": "^2.8.5"
- "express": "^4.17.1"
- "knex": "^0.19.5"
- "nodemon": "^1.19.3"
- "pg": "^7.12.1"
- "react": "^16.9.0"
- "react-dom": "^16.9.0"
- "react-scripts": "3.1.2"
- "react-tilt": "^0.1.4"
- "tachyons": "^4.11.1"

## Usage
You will be able to use this application to host your front end react application with an express server. You can also gain valuable full stack experience by woring with servers, databases and react technologies.

## Future Work
This application is a great example of connecting front end development with back end. I will hopefully create a chat bot that allows a user to log in and begin having a conversation with an automated response system. I also would like to include a chat area for future business owners to chat with one another.

## What is your major and how this project is related to your major.
I am an Information Technology/Information Systems double major with a full time offer as a software engineer. The company I will be working for along with many other companies use react and javascript for their front end languages. Building this web application allowed me to utilize my critial thinking skills and technical knowlege of software to build a simple but powerful web application. I also aspire to build my own website for my small business and this gave me the oppurtunity test out a possible frontend language.
